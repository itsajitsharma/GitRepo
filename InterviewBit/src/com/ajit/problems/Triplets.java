/**
 * You are given an integer n and two arrays each of which is a permutation of number from 1 to n.
 * Your task is to determine the number of unordered triples (a, b, c) such that the relative ordering of (a, b, c) is same
 * in both the arrays.
 *
 * Input Format:
 *      First Line: number of test cases
 *      For each test case:
 *          First line: A single integer n.
 *          next two lines: each line contains n space separated integers denoting the elements in arrays with number from 1 to n
 * Output: For each test case, print the number of ordered triplets in a new line.
 *
 * 1<=T<=100
 * 1<=n<=100000
 *
 * Sample input:
 * 1
 * 3
 * 1 2 3
 * 1 2 3
 *
 * output:
 * 1
 *
 * its possible to select only one triplet in both the arrays i.e. (1, 2, 3) and relative order of this triplet is same in both arrays.
